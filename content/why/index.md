FikaWorks was founded by a small group of independent cloud-native consultants.
After having worked independently for several years, they noticed that it was
difficult to grow as an independent. In order to be more competitive in the
market and establish a stronger brand with more recognition, they decided to
work together and start a collective.

### Mission

Our mission is to deliver exceptional value through the use of open-source,
cloud-native technologies while fostering collaboration among members to create
impactful, innovative solutions.

### Vision

Our vision is to build a thriving, inclusive collective that is recognized as a
leading force in the cloud-native and open-source ecosystem, driving meaningful
change for clients, members, and the broader IT community.

### Values

The collective is built around the 4 core principles:

- Deliver value to clients through the use of open source (cloud-native)
  technologies
- Deliver value to members through collaboration, client pool sharing and
  co-branding
- Embedding open source principles into our core operating model.
- Building strong collective capability by accepting only senior, vetted
  consultants as partners

Unlike traditional IT-consultancies who are organized in a structured,
hierarchical fashion, in our collective all members have an equal vote in
deciding where the organization is developing towards.

All members are personally vetted and are known for their impact at client
organizations and the wider IT-community.

We are an organization that is based on open source community practices.
