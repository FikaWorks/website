## Co. for collective ownership

{.text-3xl .font-medium .lg:text-5xl .mb-6 .lg:mb-8}

- **Democratic governance**: No top down leadership; 1 member = 1 vote
- **Cooperative owned by members**: We keep things flat - no employees or
  typical consultancy overheard here! Almost all of revenue goes to the people
  who deliver the work.
- **Collective Intelligence**: With us, every projects taps into the collective
  expertise of a diverse group of specialists who collaborate, share insights,
  and innovate together.
- **Transparent and accountable**: With every member as stakeholder, the coop
  creates a culture of accountability and transparency. Every decision and
  recommendation is made with both our reputation and your success in mind. We
  are not financially motivated to take on projects purely for profit or to over
  staff engagements. Instead, we focus on delivering the best outcomes by
  allocating resources based on the actual needs of the project, ensuring that
  our efforts align with our long-term values. {.list-background .inline-block
