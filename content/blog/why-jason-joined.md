We get asked a lot why we formed FikaWorks and what we have to offer a Cloud Native Engineer.
Since FikaWorks is founded by engineers my answer is the same to both questions.

So this is why I joined FikaWorks

## What I don't enjoy

I will unfortunately start with some negative experiences I have had.

I don't like being assigned to clients I cannot help because:
- our company needs to meet its [utilization numbers](consultancy-utilization)
- some sales agent sold our abilities as something they are not 
- some sales agent sold a pattern that is a poor fit for the customer
- A deal has been negotiated where we are woefully understaffed
- A deal has been negotiated where we are woefully underskilled
- being rotated off a client where I am doing good work,
because we are needed to fill a gap somewhere else, or because the other client pays more
- The lead came through a vendor (so that is really the customer)

I don't like to look at the bill our company charges the client and being acutely
aware that I won't see half of it, when I am the one bringing the value.

I don't like being driven by growth just to grow, so my salary can grow in pathetic increments,
have empty leadership positions or small bits of equity dangled in front of my face, 
while I finance someone else's "vision".

I hate my labor paying for some C-levels vanity project.

I hate "corporate career coaching" and I think it is degrading.

I hate forced socialization Friday beer and wine.

## What I enjoy

I enjoy being a contracting consultant.
I love helping my customers in their journey and nothing is more satisfying
then walking away from a job well done. I also enjoy the variety of customer 
problems I am able to solve.

I enjoy being able to vet the project myself and being able to decide if I could bring
value to a client.

I enjoy choosing my own career path, and having open discussions about my possibilities.

I enjoy the fact that every member is inherently a leader in their own fashion, and 
this can manifest in any number of ways such as
some technological skill, business acumen, moral compass, 
conflict mediation, cooking, drawing, contract negotiating, etc. 
From this group leadership comes the mutual respect amongst members.
This respect is how we are able to reach internal consensus. These disparate
skills that can run the gamut of life experience means the organization is stronger 
as a whole.
The respect also harnesses our own self worth, which feeds into our strengthening the
bonds of collaboration.

I enjoy the collaboration I get from our cooperative members as we bounce 
ideas off each other, and we explore our own journey as Cloud Native engineers.
Even if those ideas are some times controversial.

I love that we get together for beer, wine, food or any other socialization
organically. It is not mandated team unity.

I enjoy building a brand with people I trust to represent me at a client. 
A brand that is based solely on the quality of our service. 
A brand that has no motivation to exist but to serve
that goal of high quality delivery. 
There is no group motivation to compromise the brand in the service
of growth or C-Levels paycheck or share holder profits.

Every client dollar goes straight to the engineer, and if FikaWorks as a whole democratically
decides we should broadcast our brand we all contribute financial and labor efforts.

I love being democratic. I enjoy that no one person can by force of will make FikaWorks
into something it is not.

### Is is Open Sourcey

Interestingly if an engineer came to us and decided we were not a cultural fit or if their
domain of skill was not a great fit. We are actually willing and able to take our model
and show them how we built it. We encourage others to take this and build their own 
FikaWorks, anyone can fork FikaWorks, and we will share our lessons learned.

It may be counterintuitive to some, but as a founder, I enjoy that eventually FikaWorks is not just
mine. With each new member I lose a piece of the voting pie. I helped found FikaWorks but after it
was founded, through pure democracy and the fact that we bring on new members, I have in a way
let it loose into the community. Like an open source project.

Hopefully Fikaworks will take on a life of its own, which is why I joined FikaWorks.
