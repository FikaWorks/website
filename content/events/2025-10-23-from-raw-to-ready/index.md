+++
Join us on **October 17** for the next **Amsterdam.dev** meetup, organized by
**Andrea Giardini**, and hosted by **Just Eat Takeaway.com**.

This edition focuses on **data ingestion and modeling** with two great talks
from experienced engineers.

**Now Everyone Can Become a Data Engineer – Julian Alves (Fika.Works)**  
How do data teams actually start, and why does every developer end up “doing
data”? Julian will share lessons from building data pipelines and show how the
[dlt](https://dlthub.com) Python library lowers the barrier to shipping
reliable data workflows.

**Mental Models – Devdas Bhagat (Just Eat Takeaway.com)**  
Ever struggled to explain “DevOps” or “AI”? Devdas will explore mental
models—how the frameworks we use to think shape how we build and communicate.
Learn how choosing the right model can help you solve problems more
effectively.
