Join us on September 2 at Datadog HQ in Amsterdam for an in-person event with
two talks on building resilient, scalable AI systems and testing complex AI
agents.

Andrea Giardini will present “Kubernetes and AI to Protect Our Forests: A Cloud
Native Infrastructure for Wildfire Prevention”—covering data pipelines,
satellite imagery, GPU acceleration, and scalable storage for environmental
protection.

Rogério Chaves (Co-founder & CTO, LangWatch) will share practical insights on
LLM observability and testing agents through simulations.

This event is organized by AI Native Netherlands, helping bring the local AI
community together.
