Our own **Andrea Giardini** is organizing the next Amsterdam Dev meetup, this
time focused on building reliable distributed systems with Dapr:

## Hands-on Dapr Workflow Workshop for .NET Developers

Join us on **June 27** for a practical, in-person session where you'll explore
how Dapr Workflow can help you build more reliable .NET applications. We’ll
cover durable execution, task chaining, fan-out/fan-in, error handling,
retries, and more — plus you’ll get to try it all yourself. So bring your
laptop and get ready to code.

The event is co-hosted with the **.NET Amsterdam** meetup.  Thanks to
**Diagrid** for sponsoring food & drinks and to **Effectory** for providing the
venue.
