                <span class="italic text-sm">As wildfires become increasingly devastating due to climate
                change, leveraging technology for environmental protection is
                crucial. This talk focuses on the infrastructure needed to
                support AI-driven wildfire prevention systems using Kubernetes
                and cloud-native technologies. We will discuss the challenges
                of managing robust data pipelines for processing satellite
                imagery and environmental data, emphasizing the importance of
                GPU acceleration for AI. Additionally, we will explore
                strategies for efficient storage solutions to handle large
                datasets, ensuring scalability and performance. Attendees will
                gain insights into the architectural considerations and
                operational challenges of deploying an effective, resilient
                wildfire monitoring and prevention infrastructure. Join us in
                understanding how we can harness the power of technology to
                protect our forests and mitigate the impact of wildfires on our
                environment.</span>
